Hello everyone!

This is my first mod, so sorry in advance if there are bugs and issues.

When playing the new DLC, the special meteorites icons look to be bursting at the seems with their respective ore. When actually landing on one, you end up having to excavate the entire astroid only to find several small veins.
I want this new mechanic to compete with deep drilling, so the goals of this mod are as follows
- Increase the ore veins
- Less excavating, more mining
- The more ore, the more danger

Essentially, astroids should be what the on land scanner is, but on steroids consdiering you cannot choose what you are scanning for. They would feel more powerful if I didn't need to excavate a mountain to get the extra rewards.
